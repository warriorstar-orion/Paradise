# Balance Guidelines

Maps should be an unbiased playing field for players, whether ordinary crew, silicon, antagonists, or midrounds. Players should not be able to rely on a specific station layout to gain unique advantages over other players.

1. ***Maintain consistent loot counts and opportunities.*** The amount of maintenance loot drops should remain consistent, with a slight scaling factor based on expected station population. There should be no “treasure troves” or hoards of loot hidden that can only be found with specific map knowledge. Department supplies should be consistent across maps. Do not place any syndicate items/traitor tools on station; always use the provided maintenance loot spawners to maintain proper statistical likelihood of rare loot spawns.

2. ***Use appropriate reinforcement.*** Most of the station should be delineated with ordinary walls and reinforced windows. Only secure areas should use reinforced walls and grilled spawners, and electrified windows should only be used in rare cases: department head offices, technical storage, brig, xenobio, and AI satellite.

3. ***AI cameras should not have full coverage.*** The AI should not be permitted to see into every single room. This makes it challenging for antagonists to accomplish their objectives _in situ_. It is not enough to have cameras that antagonists can disable, since an AI will notice that the camera is out, when it is not usually. Areas appropriate for lacking cameras include Operating Rooms, the Therapist’s office, and Dormitory bathrooms and shower rooms. Similarly:

4. ***AI cameras should never be placed in maints.*** This is prohibited completely. It provides a disproportionately competitive advantage for sec against antagonists. Currently there is one exception to this, and that is the cameras immediately outside the solar array maintenance areas on Cyberiad. These give AI only a vague hint of what is happening nearby, and very limited visibility into events in maints.

5. ***Weak points are expected.*** The station is not a battle fortress, and it is not fun for antagonists to attempt to ingress/egress deliberately impenetrable areas. For example, Permabrig areas will typically have one or two tools just out of reach for prisoners to attempt escape. There is a toolbox in the far end of the gulag island to give gulag prisoners a chance to escape. The Head of Security’s Office is bordered by outer space on two station maps. Attempting to break into and out of sensitive areas should be challenging, but not impossible.

6. ***Occasionally place vents and scrubbers under furniture.*** Having all vents and scrubbers prominently visible hinders ventcrawling antagonists. It is easy for crew to forget to weld vents they cannot see.

7. ***Ensure security/antag balance for maintenance tunnels.*** This includes but is not limited to: having a primary path that allows navigability from all entrances; providing ways for security to flank antagonists and coordinate ambushes at maintenance entrances; ensuring that the majority of the primary corridors are 2 tiles wide to allow for serpentining and avoiding projectiles; ensuring that dead ends are rare; and providing places for antagonists to hide using hidden walls or similarly difficult to find places.
