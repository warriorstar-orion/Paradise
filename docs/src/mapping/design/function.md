# Functional Guidelines

Stations are malleable. Players can build, rebuild, decorate, upholster, and
equip the station in many ways. Mappers should take this into account when
designing areas and departments. This goes doubly so for ruins: players will
always find a way to work around the restrictions and intended flow of your
ruin. Attempting to enforce a “correct” way of interacting with a map without
deviation is impossible.

1. ***Rooms should have specific and clear functions.*** Public rooms should
   have a clear purpose. Large maintenance areas should appear to have had a
   clear purpose—an abandoned robotics department, for example, or a disused
   monkey-fighting ring. The `/area/station` subtypes enumerate most of what
   rooms are expected within a station and its departments. Even if a room is
   largely meant for player expansion, it should use an appropriate type and
   name, such as the Vacant Office.

2. ***Do not create “perfect” departments.*** The stations are not ideal
   workplaces, not state-of-the-art, and not diligently maintained by
   Nanotrasen. There should always be a gap between the ideal station and how
   the maps are designed. Departments should not come fully featured and
   configured, and should require crew interaction to set up and use
   effectively. Examples of this include Medbay preparing Operating Rooms, Cargo
   arranging the office to make access to the autolathe more convenient, and
   Engineering reconfiguring the supermatter’s pipenet. This scarcity is also
   critical to crew interactions: the Kitchen should have to rely on botany to
   make the full range of recipes, etc.

3. ***Provide surfaces.*** All jobs require managing many different objects,
   items, and pieces of equipment. There should be an adequate number of tables
   and racks available for department members to place things down and drop
   things off.

4. ***Place emergency lockers at appropriate intervals.*** Emergency closets and
   fire-safety closets should be accessible to crew at regular intervals in
   primary hallways, or just off primary hallways in adjacent maintenance
   tunnels.
