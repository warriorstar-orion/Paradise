## Ruin-Specific Guidance

1. ***Balance the risk/reward ratio of a ruin appropriately.*** If a player
   decides that the risk of running a ruin is not worth the reward, they will
   stop running it.

2. ***Not all ruins should provide rare loot.*** “Low-reward” ruins should exist
   to balance out random generation, so that every ruin in a round is not a loot
   resource. These ruins can be purely decorative, provide a place for
   role-play, or provide diegetic/environmental storytelling.

3. ***Ruins should fit the setting, and have a well signposted purpose.*** If,
   for example, your ruin is some kind of abandoned technical/research facility,
   it should should have appropriately defined areas: an obvious entrance, a
   working area for staff and crew, a testing lab, containment area for living
   specimens, some way for staff to have food, restrooms, and living
   quarters/showers if they are intended to stay on the facility for extended
   periods of time.

4. ***Avoid ‘magic’ power whenever possible.*** While infinitely regenerating
   APCs and SMES units exist, they should be used sparingly. Ruins should be as
   realistic as possible and afford players the ability to take advantage of
   being powered or unpowered to navigate or exploit the ruin when possible.

## Shuttle-Specific Guidance

1. ***Shuttles should have clearly defined secure areas and bridges.*** Secure
   areas are for security and prisoner seating. Bridges are for all Command and
   dignitaries, and include the emergency shuttle console. Consideration should
   be given for hijackers and accessibility to the emergency shuttle console, as
   well as the ability of crew to storm the bridge if necessary to prevent a
   hijack.
