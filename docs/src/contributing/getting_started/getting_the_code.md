## GETTING THE CODE

The simplest way to obtain the code is using the github .zip feature.

Click [here](https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise/archive/master.zip) to get the latest code as a .zip file, then unzip it to wherever you want.

The more complicated and easier to update method is using git.
You'll need to download git or some client from [here](http://git-scm.com/).
When that's installed, right click in any folder and click on "Git Bash".
When that opens, type in:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise.git --depth 1
```

(hint: hold down ctrl and press insert to paste into git bash)

This will take a while to download (it is the entire repo + history, not just a snapshot), but it provides an easier method for updating.
