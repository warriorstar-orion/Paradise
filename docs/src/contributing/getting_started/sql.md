## SQL Setup

The SQL backend is required for storing character saves, preferences, administrative data, and many other things.
We recommend running a database if your server is going to be used as more than just a local test server.
Your SQL server details go in the `database_configuration` section of `config.toml`,
and the SQL schema can be found in `SQL/paradise_schema.sql`.
