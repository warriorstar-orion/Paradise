## UPDATING

If you used the zip method,
you'll need to download the zip file again and unzip it somewhere else,
and then copy the `config` and `data` folders over.

If you used the git method, you simply need to type this in to git bash:

```sh
    git pull --depth 1
```

When you have done this, you'll need to recompile the code, but then it should work fine and be up to date with the live server.
